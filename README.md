# 🐾 🐶 Petstore API – Cypress Automation Project

---

##  🖥️ Project Description

The **Petstore API Automation Project** is a Cypress-based testing suite designed to ensure the reliability and quality of the [Swagger Petstore API](https://petstore.swagger.io/).
It demonstrates skills in **backend (API) testing** using Cypress and JavaScript, following modern best practices for structure, test data management, and reporting.

All API tests are modular and use **fixtures** for clean, reusable data. The project leverages environment variables, parallel execution, and automated reporting to mirror real-world QA workflows.

---

## ⚙️ Features

* **Cypress API Testing:**
  Automated validation of core Petstore API endpoints (CRUD for pets, store, users, etc.).
* **Reusable Fixtures:**
  Centralized test data management in JSON files.
* **Environment Variable Support:**
  Easily switch target API environments (dev, staging, prod) via `.env`.
* **Parallel Test Execution:**
  Run tests in parallel for fast feedback using `cypress-parallel`.
* **Automated Reporting:**
  Rich HTML and JSON test reports with Mochawesome.
* **CI/CD Ready:**
  Example GitHub Actions workflow for automated test runs.


---

## 🕒 Automated CI Schedule

```bash
 schedule:
    - cron: '0 11 * * *'   #run every day at  5:00 AM Chicago time (CST)
```

- **Nightly runs:**  
  This project’s test suite is **automatically triggered every day at 5:00 AM Chicago time (CST)** via a scheduled GitHub Actions workflow.

- **Configuration:**  
  The schedule is managed using this [cron expression](https://crontab.guru/#0_11_*_*_*):

- **Purpose:**  
Ensures API health and test coverage are validated every day without manual intervention.  
All test results and reports are generated and can be accessed in the GitHub Actions workflow logs and artifacts.

## 🔧 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nara-Bayaraa/Petstore-Api-Automation-Cypress.git
   cd Petstore-Api
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
